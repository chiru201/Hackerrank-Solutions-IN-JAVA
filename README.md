Java Date and Time

The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a
specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on,
and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.
You are given a date. Your task is to find what the day is on that date.
